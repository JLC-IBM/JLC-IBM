- 👋 Hi, I’m @JLC-IBM
- 👀 I’m interested in working out if this will stay live, if it does then I'll be surprised.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning if this gets deleted when my IBM email does as well.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, (sorry, busy!)
- 📫 You cannot reach me via email or anything else, as I will have left.
